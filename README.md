# text-binary-classifier
Practice training neural networks for text classification with Tensorflow/Keras.

Includes MNIST benchmark example. Jupyter notebooks implement multiple models to perform binary classification on sentences. 

Begins with a simple logistic regression, introduces text vectorization, then adds dense layers using Keras, pre-trained text embeddings (trainable and not), a 1d CNN layer, and finally an RNN layer (LSTM).

Data are 6,000 labeled tweets from Joe Biden and Donald Trump, and reviews from IMDb, Yelp, and Amazon labeled by sentiment.
