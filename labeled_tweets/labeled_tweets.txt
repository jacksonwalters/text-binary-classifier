The deadly violence we saw overnight in Portland is unacceptable. Shooting in the streets of a great American city is unacceptable. I condemn violence of every kind by anyone, whether on the left or the right. And I challenge Donald Trump to do the same. https://t.co/JRuI7ya2Wv	0
Donald Trump has been president for almost four years. The temperature in the country is higher, tensions run stronger, divisions run deeper. And all of us are less safe because he can’t do the job of the American president.	0
I’m thrilled to announce our grassroots fundraiser with our friends. I hope you’ll join @DrBiden, @JVN, @Karamo, @TanFrance, @Antoni, and @BobbyBerk this Tuesday. Chip in to reserve your spot: https://t.co/WV2DfZxixR https://t.co/QmsevDhVSb	0
This video is doctored — and a flagrant attempt to spread misinformation at the expense of a man who uses assistive technology. It should be removed. Now. https://t.co/Bnv5H2NhZT	0
There’s a lot happening, but I hope we don’t overlook the brave fire fighters &amp; emergency responders in the wake of Hurricane Laura. When the storm hit, they stayed behind—even while their homes were being destroyed—to help their community recover. True American heroes.	0
We’re going to build back better and we will do it while creating a brighter future for you and your families. This week @KamalaHarris and I sit down to discuss how we are going to move forward—together. Join us on Tuesday. https://t.co/hebSifEEHL	0
We are facing so many crises under Donald Trump: COVID. Economic devastation. Unwarranted police violence. Emboldened white nationalists. A reckoning on race. Declining faith in a bright American future. The common thread? A president who makes things worse — not better.	0
Does anyone believe there will be less violence in America if Donald Trump is reelected?	0
Donald Trump can’t stop the violence we're seeing today – because for years he has fomented it. Tune in as I discuss the need for justice and safety in America: https://t.co/gSXuP0jc5D	0
Donald Trump may believe mouthing the words law and order makes him strong, but his failure to call on his own supporters to stop acting as an armed militia in this country shows you how weak he is.	0
I want a safe America — safe from COVID, safe from crime and looting, safe from racially motivated violence, safe from bad cops. And let’s be crystal clear: Safe from four more years of Donald Trump.	0
The simple truth is Donald Trump failed to protect America. So now, he’s trying to scare America.	0
Trump and Pence are running on this: “You won’t be safe in Joe Biden’s America.” And what’s their proof? The violence you’re seeing in Donald Trump’s America.	0
Donald Trump keeps telling us if he was president, you'd feel safe. Well, he is president — whether he knows it or not.	0
Mr. President, it’s high time you condemn violence of any form. https://t.co/rQlXyadZid	0
More cops have died from COVID this year than have been killed on patrol. Nearly one in six small businesses in this country are closed. Do you really feel safer under Trump?	0
Anyone who met Amari will tell you that he was a charismatic young man—poised for greatness. He was ready and willing to take on the world. I can tell you that in 20 years, we all would have been saying, ‘Amari for President.’ #AmariForPresident https://t.co/aa01lftpzt	0
The truth is Donald Trump can't stop the violence, because for years he has fomented it. https://t.co/nxqas2Uv5s	0

Donald Trump looks at this violence and sees a political lifeline. He failed to protect America, so now he's trying to scare America. https://t.co/BCoO4gS2zE	0
If Donald Trump wants to ask the question: Who will keep you safer as President? Let’s answer it. https://t.co/pDXCqzRbQe	0
Fear never builds the future — hope does. https://t.co/V0jCGRBBG7	0
I urge President Trump to join me in saying that while peaceful protest is an important right — violence is wrong. Period. If he can’t say that, then he is unfit to be President. https://t.co/W4sjpF0Z3V	0
Tonight, President Trump declined to rebuke violence. He wouldn’t even repudiate one of his supporters who is charged with murder. He is too weak, too scared of the hatred he has stirred to put an end to it.	0
President Shri Pranab Mukherjee was a devout public servant who believed deeply in the importance of our two nations tackling global challenges together. Jill and I are saddened to hear of his passing — our prayers go out to his loved ones and the Indian people. https://t.co/SJfaDEKjGi	0
Today’s press conference made it clear: we are all less safe because Donald Trump has failed at his job. We need a President who will stop violence — not incite it. https://t.co/AhGNZCDQkr	0
Across the country, people rely on public transportation to get to work, see loved ones, and access essential services. But that's all under threat because Republicans refuse to do their jobs. Congress must act now to save public transit.	0
Our nation is at an inflection point. @KamalaHarris and I sat down to discuss what brought us to this moment — and how we move forward and build back better than before. Tune in to watch: https://t.co/PlmeffTySN	0
We need a president who will lower the temperature and bring the country together — not one who raises it and tears us further apart. https://t.co/e6aFLx9iqU	0

If I’m elected president, I promise you that America will be better prepared to deal with any threats that come our way. That starts with restoring the PREDICT program that President Trump ended. https://t.co/7jDkOaLc8P	0

Last month we raised $364.5 million — 95% of the donations from grassroots supporters like you and the majority online. Working people are powering our campaign — and I’m grateful. We’ve got a long way to go to close the fundraising gap and win — but we can do it. Together.	0
This campaign is powered by grassroots supporters like you — and every dollar counts to close the fundraising gap with the Trump campaign. $5, $10, $15, whatever you can, chip in today: https://t.co/pHQWesk2AR	0
President Trump has failed to address COVID-19 — and now our students and educators are paying the price. Tune in as I discuss my plan to safely and effectively reopen schools: https://t.co/ntofl4zV7v	0
We all want students back in the classroom, but President Trump hasn't done the work to make sure schools can reopen safely and effectively. @KamalaHarris and I will be ready on day 1 with a roadmap for reopening. https://t.co/yJswM3PliF	0
Donald Trump and Betsy DeVos are the worst possible people to lead our nation’s schools through this pandemic.	0

Time and time again, President Trump has refused to stand up to Putin. His silence on the poisoning of Mr. Navalny is just the latest example. As president, I'll do what Trump won't: hold the Putin regime accountable for its crimes. https://t.co/z11YyV6lq0	0
I've always believed we're at our best when we act as one America. It's time for us to come together, propel our nation across this turbulent threshold, and build a better future for all.	0
Right now, classrooms should be humming with excitement for a new year and students’ hopes for their futures. Instead, many are silent and empty because President Trump didn’t do his job. America’s families are paying the price for his failures.	0
It’s time we come together as a nation to heal and address the challenges we face. Tune in to our community conversation in Kenosha, Wisconsin: https://t.co/5Vda70tPCu	0
We need a president who will work to lower the temperature — not raise it. A president who will bring people together and find solutions to the challenges we face. That's what I went to Kenosha to do today, and it's what I'll do every day in the White House. https://t.co/dNenwVZjUg	0

In 2016, President Trump promised to reduce the trade deficit and said: "You will see a drop like you've never seen before." The reality? It's the highest it's been in 12 years. American workers can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/3CGY4Hym8o	0

Now is not the time for a victory lap, Mr. President. Just because your wealthy friends and donors are doing well doesn't mean everyone else is. Get off the golf course. Call the leaders of Congress to the White House. And make a deal that delivers for working people.	0
I'm grateful for everyone who found work in August and found that glimmer of hope — but there is real cause for concern in this morning's jobs report. The pace of job gains in August was slower than in July. And significantly slower than May or June.	0
The fact is we're more than six months into this pandemic, and: - 11.5 million Americans don't have their jobs back - Almost 30 million are on unemployment - We're down 720,000 manufacturing jobs - Nearly 1 in 6 small businesses have closed their doors	0

Mr. President, enough with the weekend golf trips and erratic tweets. It's time for you to get to work and control the spread of this virus. https://t.co/SfsEQMgc5z	0
Nicaraguan asylum seekers fleeing oppression deserve to have their cases heard. Instead, they’re being deported back into the tyrannical grip of Daniel Ortega without a chance to pursue their claims. President Trump’s cruelty truly knows no bounds. https://t.co/FxhjCUXkZ8	0
As president, I will: - Call for nationwide mask mandates - Implement widespread testing - Accelerate the development of treatments and vaccines I’m ready to work on day one to contain the spread of this virus and get our country back on track.	0
The economy wasn’t working for folks long before this virus hit. That’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’re going to build back better. We’re going to make sure everyone has a fair shot to get ahead. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0	0

Donald Trump promised to be "the greatest jobs president God ever created." But in reality, he's on track to become the first president in modern history to leave office with fewer jobs than when he entered. American workers can't take four more years of his failed leadership.	0
Time and again, the president has refused to provide Puerto Rico with much-needed resources. He’s repeatedly insulted Puerto Ricans and this latest action is another example of his disrespect for the island. This ends when I’m elected president. https://t.co/FitVSFl8bS	0

For years, President Trump and Republicans have waged a war on America's labor unions. It will end on my watch. I'll sign the PRO Act — making it easier for workers to organize and collectively bargain — and be the strongest labor president workers have ever had.	0
It's not enough to just thank our essential workers — we need to pay them. As president, I’ll: - Raise the minimum wage to $15 - End the tipped minimum wage - End the sub-minimum wage for people with disabilities - Ensure everyone has strong benefits	0
Wall Street didn't build this country — the middle class did. And unions built the middle class. Donald Trump doesn't understand that. We need a president who does.	0
As president, I’ll make record investments in American industry and create millions of good-paying, union jobs. We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — and built by union workers. https://t.co/rt5RD9Fdi0	0
Mr. President — If you’re so good at making deals, then why does your trade deal cost American workers so much pain while letting China off the hook for its biggest trade abuses? https://t.co/mL8a67CTAw	0
At our best, America has always been generous, kind, and optimistic. We treat each other with dignity, give hate no safe harbor, and leave no one behind. I believe we can be that nation once again.	0
This economy may be working great for Donald Trump and his wealthy friends — but it's not working for the rest of America. It's time we change that.	0

Just months ago, Donald Trump was planning to allow oil and gas drilling off the coast of Florida. Now, with 56 days until the election, he conveniently says that he changed his mind. Unbelievable. You don't have to guess where I stand: I oppose new offshore drilling. https://t.co/oxfQNIymBh	0

Given his track record, no one can take Trump’s word alone on a COVID-19 vaccine. But with satisfactory answers to these questions, every American can have confidence in a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. https://t.co/074K1HD9wf	0
3: What is the plan to allocate and distribute vaccines to Americans cost-free, safely, equitably, and without politics? President Trump should release a detailed distribution plan to ensure every American — not just the wealthy and well-connected — receives the vaccine.	0
2: Who will validate that the Administration’s decision to greenlight a COVID-19 vaccine is driven by science and not political motivation? We must hear uncensored statements on efficacy and safety from @FDACBER, the @US_FDA vaccine advisory committee, and Dr. Fauci.	0
A safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine could save countless lives. We need one as soon as possible. But while I see a vaccine as a product of science, President Trump sees it as a political tool. Politics should play no role in this. The Administration must answer the following:	0
1: What criteria will be used to ensure a vaccine meets the scientific standard of safety and efficacy? The FDA must clarify what criteria it will use, and President Trump must commit to respecting the independent judgment of the non-political professional staff at the FDA.	0

If Donald Trump had acted just two weeks earlier, 54,000 lives could have been spared in March and April alone. Instead, he downplayed the threat and refused to take action — costing lives and sending our economy into a tailspin. It’s an unjustifiable dereliction of duty.	0
You deserve a president who tells you the truth.	0
Donald Trump knew that COVID-19 was dangerous. He knew it was deadly. And he purposely downplayed it. Now, nearly 200,000 Americans are dead. It’s unconscionable. https://t.co/SLqqhmWy8E	0
I got to meet Lou Brock back in March. I joked that I had really just come to St. Louis to see him—and let me tell you, our meeting was a real highlight. Lou was a true legend and a man of integrity.

Donald Trump said he didn't want to tell the truth and create a panic. So he did nothing and created a disaster.	0

Donald Trump is holding a rally in Michigan today—while also refusing to fully fund their National Guard.

More than 1,000 people died from COVID yesterday. @realDonaldTrump watched eight hours of TV. If I’m president, you might not always agree with me. But I promise you I will always show up and fight for you. https://t.co/HvVJLS83TZ	0
Donald Trump said he wanted to be a cheerleader for the country. We didn't need a cheerleader. We needed a president.	0
As a nation, we must never forget those we lost on 9/11 and the incredible bravery of our first responders. Though the wounds of that day will never fully heal, the spirit of Americans recovered as it always does — unbowed by the efforts of those who strike against it. https://t.co/Ogn7Sbvq1Q	0
Nineteen years ago, our nation was tested by an unspeakable act of cowardice and hate. Nearly 3,000 lives were cut short: a once-unthinkable toll which tore open the hearts of Americans in every corner of the country. https://t.co/6rAF0dAd1Y	0
This year, we mark the anniversary of 9/11 in the midst of another crisis that compels us to summon the best of the American people in the face of unconscionable, inconceivable loss — a crisis that has already taken nearly 200,000 Americans.	0
Now, as then, our heroes are ordinary people doing extraordinary things: nurses and doctors; delivery drivers and grocery clerks; public transit workers and educators; regular Americans thrust into courageous acts of sacrifice and service.	0
And now, as then, we owe it to them to come together as a nation — so that Americans can once again do what we did so bravely nineteen years ago: turn from tragedy to purpose, rebuild our lives, and begin, in time, to heal.	0
Always remember. https://t.co/BwaBSo8LFq	0
You deserve a President and Vice President who will spend every minute of every day working to make your life better. I promise that’s exactly what @KamalaHarris and I will do.	0

As president, I’ll impose a tax penalty on companies that ship jobs overseas and sell products back to the U.S. — and I’ll create millions of good-paying jobs here at home. We’re going to make sure the future is made in America — by all of America's workers. https://t.co/8smOm5MGx1	0
Iran’s cruel execution of Navid Afkari is a travesty. No country should arrest, torture, or execute peaceful protestors or activists. Iran must free its other political prisoners, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, and release unjustly detained Americans. https://t.co/Jj9QZbyQL7	0
I promise you that if I’m elected president, I’ll never forget what the job is about. It’s about you — the American people. https://t.co/ACGjYymWSg	0
Donald Trump and I have pretty different philosophies when it comes to giving our word. Mine means something. When I tell the American people I’m going to do something — I follow through. https://t.co/FCHpIGHtf2	0
In a Biden-Harris administration, “Buy American” will be more than a slogan. We’re going to invest an additional $400 billion in purchasing American-made products and keep good-paying jobs here at home. https://t.co/HrOOkXerMP	0
This cold-blooded shooting is unconscionable and the perpetrator must be brought to justice. Violence of any kind is wrong; those who commit it should be caught and punished.

26 years ago today, the Senate passed 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines—it was an effort I was proud to champion. These bans saved lives, and Congress should have never let them expire. As president, I’ll take on the @NRA and we’ll ban them once again.	0

26 years ago today, the Violence Against Women Act became law. In the years since, it has saved countless lives and helped change the culture around sexual assault and domestic violence. Writing and championing the law remains one of my proudest accomplishments. https://t.co/9pV7X9fgKq	0
With each reauthorization, VAWA has become stronger. The latest bill—passed by the House last year—would close loopholes allowing abusers to obtain guns and extend protections for Native women. But Mitch McConnell refuses to bring it to the floor for a vote. It’s despicable.	0

Hispanic Heritage Month is a reminder of the strength we draw as a nation from our immigrant roots. No matter where your family came from, we're here because we all share the same ideals. That's the story of America — and it is well worth celebrating. https://t.co/rign44stJc	0
To be clear: I am not currently president. But if you chip in now, we can change that in November: https://t.co/eFS4tDfHEx https://t.co/ciqFcIGLHB	0
Donald Trump’s climate denial may not have directly caused the record fires we’re seeing on the West Coast. But if he gets four more years in the White House, they’ll only become more common, devastating, and deadly. https://t.co/7rsG9VDZ4w	0
Science will win. https://t.co/1KRipY9MCi	0
The fact of the matter is Donald Trump doesn't have a health care plan. I do — and you can read it here: https://t.co/gm6jgUrcaT https://t.co/LbvDvFj4m8	0
We’ve lost nearly 200,000 Americans to COVID-19. It didn’t have to be this bad — but Donald Trump failed to do his job.	0
We all want a COVID-19 vaccine as soon as possible, but it needs to be based on science — not politics. Tune in as I discuss how we can develop and equitably distribute a safe and effective vaccine: https://t.co/KPxTaqAiVd	0
We can’t allow the Good Friday Agreement that brought peace to Northern Ireland to become a casualty of Brexit. Any trade deal between the U.S. and U.K. must be contingent upon respect for the Agreement and preventing the return of a hard border. Period. https://t.co/Ecu9jPrcHL	0
When I said I trust vaccines, and I trust the scientists, but I don't trust Donald Trump — this is what I meant: https://t.co/oBDXcFUAek	0
This is Donald Trump’s America after one term. Why would we give him a second? https://t.co/E2dwc6R30h	0
We’re going to get this virus under control and get your life back on track.	0
If you give a climate arsonist four more years in the White House, why would anyone be surprised if more of America is ablaze? https://t.co/DwCIoNkwk1	0
President Trump promised the opioid crisis would end "quickly" if he won, but the fact is drug overdose deaths are up nearly 10% across the country. It's heartbreaking. As president, I promise I'll take action to end this epidemic. https://t.co/tnVAqXbXpm	0
Yesterday, I met with some of our nation's top experts to discuss how we distribute a safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine. If I win this election, I know that there won't be a minute to waste. I'll get to work on day one implementing an effective distribution plan. https://t.co/GfgSnBwjTQ	0
We've had to endure President Trump's incompetence and dishonesty when it comes to testing, wearing masks, and socially distancing. We can't afford a repeat of those fiascos with a COVID-19 vaccine. The stakes are too high.	0
.@realDonaldTrump, the job is to be president of all Americans. For the love of God start acting like it. https://t.co/kkHf9aWZmR	0
If you make under $400,000, you will not pay a penny more in taxes when I'm president. The super-wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share — and we'll invest that money in working families. We're going to reward work — not wealth.	0
The 100 richest Americans have made more than $300 billion during the COVID-19 crisis. Now, in the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, Donald Trump wants to give them a $29 billion tax break. Let that sink in.	0
Ahead of #RoshHashanah, Jill and I want to wish everyone in the Jewish community a very happy, healthy, and sweet New Year. Tune in to our virtual event: https://t.co/ECEfGRqX5n	0
No surprise, Donald Trump is lying about my tax plan. Here’s the truth about how I’ll make corporations pay their fair share while ensuring Americans making under $400,000 don’t pay a penny more. https://t.co/0cpJjpCS33	0
I’m looking forward to being back in my home town of Scranton, Pennsylvania, for tonight’s CNN Town Hall. Tune in at 8 PM ET to watch. https://t.co/yHez7c4gaq	0
Donald Trump wants to give his rich friends another tax cut, so they pay a lower tax rate than tens of millions of essential workers and middle class Americans. We need a president who cares about more than the wealthy and well-connected.	0
I’m about to take the stage for tonight’s Town Hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania. Tune in to @CNN now to watch live. https://t.co/zi0P1gcAiU	0
President Trump knew how deadly COVID-19 was and did nothing. It’s close to criminal. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/OL3uIA1QSZ	0
This election is Scranton vs. Park Avenue.	0
The choice in this election couldn’t be more clear. We can choose four more years of Donald Trump’s dark and divisive politics. Or we can choose a path of hope and light—and build a better future for all. Chip in to help us win. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/a1aSMb7x1G	0
I'll tell you what takes away your freedom: not being able to see your kid, go to the football game, or see your mom or dad in the hospital. That's what is costing us our freedom. #BidenTownHall https://t.co/YM57H8lv2K	0

Donald Trump claimed he would be "the greatest jobs president God ever created." But the fact is he's the worst jobs president in recorded history. We can't afford another four years of his failed leadership. https://t.co/uW10KJhMsV	0
When we needed Donald Trump to tell the truth about COVID-19, he lied to us. When we needed him to take action to contain its spread, he spent his days golfing. When we needed a president the most, he was nowhere to be found. It's unforgivable.	0
I can't believe I have to say this, but if I'm elected president, I won't put a climate change denier — one who called the scientific community "a bunch of thugs" — in charge of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. https://t.co/FcRtv8ZcYS	0

Ruth Bader Ginsburg stood for all of us. She was an American hero, a giant of legal doctrine, and a relentless voice in the pursuit of that highest American ideal: Equal Justice Under Law. May her memory be a blessing to all people who cherish our Constitution and its promise.	0
Let me be clear: The voters should pick a President, and that President should select a successor to Justice Ginsburg.	0
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg inspired us all. https://t.co/vQQiB1oQ2J	0
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought for all of us. She was a giant of the Court and unflinching in her pursuit of equal justice under the law. Because of her life’s work, we are closer to that more perfect union we’ve always strived to be. https://t.co/o30ZCuj10G	0
The Supreme Court is on the ballot. And the outcome will impact everything from health care to civil rights — affecting generations to come. Vote. Our future depends on it. https://t.co/Hy8C4mIL2M	0
We must win.	0
I’m Joe Biden and I approve this message. https://t.co/TuRZXPE5xK	0
It was my honor to preside over Justice Ginsburg’s confirmation hearings, and to support her accession to the Supreme Court. Her opinions, and her dissents, will shape the basis of our law for generations to come — and we’ll be a more just and equal nation because of it. https://t.co/SmZD2KyyyG	0

En el tercer aniversario del huracán María, no es suficiente recordar la devastación provocada por la tormenta. Debemos actuar para asegurarnos de que nada como esto vuelva a suceder y asegurar que Puerto Rico reciba la dignidad y el respeto que se merece. https://t.co/x0Hvmq7Qnz	0
On the third anniversary of Hurricane Maria, it’s not enough to just remember the devastation wrought by the storm. We must act to ensure nothing like it ever happens again and to ensure Puerto Rico gets the full dignity and respect it deserves. https://t.co/2zOkcVkYEz	0
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was proof that courage, conviction, and moral clarity can change not just the law — but also the world. https://t.co/G50Y2KBtWL	0
Let me be clear: LGBTQ+ rights are human rights — and “LGBT-free zones” have no place in the European Union or anywhere in the world. https://t.co/zc8YvSq6iN	0
If this reporting is true, this complaint is deeply concerning and needs to be independently investigated immediately. These women are entitled to be treated with dignity and respect. Practices like this would end in a Biden Administration. https://t.co/Yrf3qW5f7E	0
In this moment, we're facing both a public health crisis and an economic crisis because Donald Trump failed to do his job. I'm in Manitowoc, Wisconsin, to discuss what I'll do to get our nation back on track. Tune in. https://t.co/kMjzL2GAi7	0
Thank you for the warm welcome, Manitowoc! With the help of companies like Wisconsin Aluminum Foundry, we're going to revitalize American manufacturing and make sure the future is made here in America. https://t.co/G2IPTLrhHZ	0
When the virus came, President Trump wasn’t thinking about you, he was thinking about his own reelection. It’s how Trump looks at the world: It’s always about him, never about us. You deserve a president who will put you first.	0
Donald Trump ran for office saying he would represent the forgotten men and women of this country — and as soon as he got in office, he forgot about us.	0
Today, we'll pass another grim milestone in this pandemic: 200,000 American lives lost. Jill and I are keeping everyone who's hurting in our prayers. No words can numb your pain, but know the nation grieves with you. Today is dark, but we will overcome this. Keep the faith.	0
While other nations worked around the clock to get this virus under control, our president was too busy tweeting and golfing. Now, nearly 200,000 Americans have died. It didn’t have to happen this way. https://t.co/RqdLtARlRW	0
200,000 Americans have died from this virus. It’s a staggering number that’s hard to wrap your head around. But behind every COVID-19 death is a family and community that will never again be the same. There’s a devastating human toll to this pandemic — and we can’t forget that.	0
It didn’t have to be this bad. https://t.co/R2WqNeauiu	0

I’ve dealt with guys like Donald Trump my whole life. Guys who look down on you because they’ve got a lot of money. Guys who think they’re better than you. Guys who inherited everything they ever got in life — and then squandered it. https://t.co/o4q5M6VuJC	0
This is our moment to tackle systemic racism head-on and build a nation true to our founding ideals. A nation where all men and women are not only created equal — but treated equally. Here's how we'll advance racial economic equity: https://t.co/Tjgyn1gR2V	0

The 200,000 people we've lost to COVID-19 weren't nobodies, Mr. President. They were our parents and grandparents, sons and daughters, friends and co-workers. They were Americans. https://t.co/EcdaEiwgUS	0
Even amidst the profound grief &amp; anger today's decision generated, violence is never &amp; can never be the answer. Those who engage in it must be held accountable. Jill &amp; I are keeping the officers shot tonight in Louisville in our prayers. We wish them both a swift &amp; full recovery.	0

In-person early voting should be easy and convenient for all. The Flint, MI City Clerk's office will be open the last three weekends before Election Day for folks to cast their ballots. It's an example that cities and states across the country should follow.	0
The Trump Administration says "the entire ACA must fall." They are arguing to strip millions of Americans of health care in the middle of a pandemic. We can't let him win. https://t.co/bcwiGz1HOn	0
Once again, we are called to ask ourselves whether justice could be equally applied in America. But what's clear is that today in America, Black women deserve better.	0
I've spent my career working to end violence against women and will fight to end the epidemic of missing and murdered indigenous women. I applaud Congress for passing Savanna's Act this week. Now, the Senate and President Trump need to reauthorize VAWA. It's long overdue. https://t.co/Xru7YzAUBD	0
Thank you, @CindyMcCain. Your support and your friendship mean the world to me. John and I didn't always agree on the issues, but we put aside our differences to find common ground and move the country forward — it's what I'll do every day as president. https://t.co/KheAlsKt73	0
In the middle of a global pandemic, President Trump is trying to get the U.S. Supreme Court to eliminate Obamacare and rip health care protections away from 100 million Americans with pre-existing conditions. Don't forget that.	0
Health care is a right — not a privilege.	0
Obamacare was—and is—a big deal. As president, I’ll protect and build on it, lower health care costs, and give Americans the opportunity to choose a new public option. We’re going to make sure everyone has access to the affordable health care they need. https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C	0
We are in the middle of a climate emergency — and every day that Donald Trump remains in the White House further threatens the future of our planet. We have to vote him out. https://t.co/NkSJ7bvBoE	0
The unrelenting impact of climate change affects every single one of us. It requires action, not denial. It requires leadership, not scapegoating. It requires a president to meet the threshold duty of the office — to care, for everyone.	0
Today, Justice Ginsburg made history one last time — and I was grateful to be there to pay my respects. May her memory be a blessing — and may we continue to be voices for justice in her name. https://t.co/TMJeYw0d89	0

If I'm elected, I won't wait to take action on COVID-19. Minutes after the race is called, I’ll call Dr. Fauci and ask him to stay on. During my transition, I’ll bring together experts and leaders from both parties to chart a path forward. We will overcome this, together.	0
Today is Public Lands Day and National Hunting and Fishing Day — and what better way to celebrate than the long overdue removal of William Perry Pendley from @blmnational. It's a victory for everyone who values our public lands over those who want to exploit them for profit. https://t.co/lZxDF4PzH6	0
At this moment, we're facing both the worst public health crisis of our lifetime and the existential threat of climate change. We need a president who believes in science.	0
When Ebola hit, President Obama and I took swift action and successfully contained the virus. After COVID-19 hit, President Trump lied to the American people and said it would miraculously "disappear." Now, over 200,000 lives have been cut short. It's a national tragedy.	0
Today, President Trump nominated Judge Amy Coney Barrett to the Supreme Court — a jurist with a written track record of disagreeing with the Court’s decision to uphold the Affordable Care Act. Vote like your health care is on the ballot — because it is. https://t.co/TDBQOVLP4K	0
Supreme Court decisions affect our everyday lives, and the Constitution was designed to give voters a voice on who makes those decisions. The Senate shouldn't act until after the American people select their next president and the next Congress. Americans deserve to be heard.	0
The Senate shouldn't vote until the American people do.	0
In the middle of a pandemic, Donald Trump is trying to force through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him destroy Obamacare. Health care is at stake. Protections for pre-existing conditions are at stake. We can't let them win. https://t.co/zIdPmxzYtQ	0
Thank you @TheRock for your support at this critical moment for our nation. You said it best: This election is about earning the respect of the American people. It’s about decency.

The truth is the economy wasn’t working for folks long before these crises hit. It’s why @KamalaHarris and I won’t just build back to the way things were — we’ll build back better. We won’t be satisfied until the economy starts working for everyone.	0
Jill, Kamala, Doug, and our families all extend our warmest wishes to all who observe Yom Kippur. May you have an easy and meaningful fast. And may you be sealed in the Book of Life. https://t.co/z4EMRDH8Y5	0

There's no mystery when it comes to what's happening with the Supreme Court. President Trump and Republicans have been trying to throw out Obamacare for years — and now they see an opening to get it done. We can't let them get away with it.	0
Here's the deal: Until we deal with COVID-19, we'll never get our economy fully back on track, get our kids safely back to school, or get our lives back. It's why as president, I won't waste a day getting this virus under control. https://t.co/xjxsDmKPe3	0

The American people understand the urgency of this moment. They're voting in droves because their health care hangs in the balance. But Donald Trump doesn't care — he sees a chance to eliminate Obamacare and rip away health care protections from millions. It's unconscionable.	0
With casualties rapidly mounting in and around Nagorno-Karabakh, the Trump Administration needs to call the leaders of Armenia and Azerbaijan immediately to de-escalate the situation. It must also demand others — like Turkey — stay out of this conflict. https://t.co/C41YKEGTyA	0

President Trump keeps promising to protect Americans with pre-existing conditions, but the truth is he’s in Court trying to rip their protections away. And now, he’s trying to jam through the confirmation of a Justice who will help him get it done. We can’t let him win.	0
The American people deserve to have a say in who the Supreme Court nominee is. https://t.co/jnFXiDkt2c	0
It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is.	0
When I hear 200,000 deaths, I think of the empty chairs at dining room tables all across the country, which just months ago were filled by loved ones. It didn’t have to be this bad.	0
Donald Trump is the worst president we've ever had.	0
Show us your tax returns, @realDonaldTrump.	0
On average, roughly 750 to 1,000 Americans are dying from COVID every day. When Donald Trump was presented with that number, he said, “It is what it is.” It is what it is because Donald Trump is who he is. https://t.co/OOm2pVRijz	0

I need you in my corner tonight. Can you chip in before I take the debate stage and help power this campaign through the final 12 days? https://t.co/RAUkSHc6ce	0
Ready. https://t.co/RYbnSpEsKB	0
220,000 deaths. If you hear nothing else I say tonight, hear this: Anyone who is responsible for that many deaths should not remain President of the United States.	0
Learning to live with it? Come on. People are dying with it, Mr. President.	0
I’m going to shut down the virus, not the country.	0
I don’t look at this the way Donald Trump does — blue states or red states. They’re all the United States.	0
I am proud that the average contribution to my campaign is $43. Chip in to power our grassroots movement through this final stretch: https://t.co/foyJuIKiYo	0
Donald Trump should release his tax returns or shut up about corruption.	0
I don’t see our country in terms of blue states and red states. We are the United States. https://t.co/7G5IXGA9fu	0
Malarkey!	0
It’s not about his family or my family. It’s about your family. If you’re a middle-class family right now, you’re hurting badly.	0
I have released all of my tax returns. 22 years. Go look at them. What is Donald Trump hiding? https://t.co/2TNt0z1QMw	0
We’ve been waiting years for President Trump to reveal his grand plan for health care, and he still has nothing to show. I’ve laid out exactly what I’ll do. Take a look: https://t.co/34NCSYhO2C	0
He’s a confused guy. He doesn’t know who he’s running against. He’s running against Joe Biden.	0
All Donald Trump can see from Park Avenue is Wall Street. He thinks the economy is doing well if the Dow Jones is doing well. Believe it or not, Mr. President, most Americans don't live off the stock market.	0
This isn’t about Donald Trump’s family or my family. This is about your family. Families across America are hurting — but that’s the last thing Donald Trump wants to talk about. https://t.co/qWMgnLHxKY	0
Call it Bidencare. https://t.co/Ng3Fvk4fpY	0
Equality and justice — the American creed. We have never lived up to it, but we’ve never stopped trying — until this President.	0
You know who I am. You know who he is. The character of the country is on the ballot. Look at us closely.	0
Donald Trump has a dog whistle about as big as a foghorn.	0
Kids were ripped from their parents’ arms, and now they can't find their parents. Those kids are alone. With nowhere to go. It’s criminal. https://t.co/HsfQayx3ZV	0
There is institutional racism in America. We have to give everyone a fair shot. https://t.co/rB8qzFT8rR	0
You know who I am. You know who Donald Trump is. The character of the country is on the ballot. https://t.co/LdiIAOhHLj	0
Donald Trump is the most racist president in modern history. https://t.co/6GyKSbRoHA	0
Decency, honor, respect, treating people with dignity, making sure that everyone has an even chance. I'm going to make sure you get that. You haven't been getting it the last four years. https://t.co/KhQIGGZHIH	0
I'm running as a proud Democrat, but I will govern as an American president. I will represent you — whether you vote for me or against me.	0
Folks, I just stepped off the debate stage, and I’ve never been more fired up and ready to win this election. Now, I need your help — chip in to keep tonight’s momentum going through Election Day: https://t.co/9lrG3uFUIx	0

.@BarackObama is right: President Trump wants full credit for the economy he inherited and zero blame for the pandemic he ignored. https://t.co/tCD5UST32J	0
You deserve a president who tells you the truth. https://t.co/wz20ghT2fu	0
After eight months of this pandemic, we finally found President Trump's plan to beat COVID-19. https://t.co/KO4g328Uvr	0
64 years ago today, freedom-loving Hungarians revolted against communist rule. Their spirit inspired the Prague Spring, Poland's Solidarity movement, and the fall of the Berlin Wall. As president, I'll always stand in defense of democracy and freedom at home and around the world.	0
A slight change of tone from the president for one night doesn’t cover up the lies he told. It doesn’t change the fact that over 220,000 Americans have died from COVID-19 on his watch. We can’t take another four years of Donald Trump’s failed leadership.	0
There is nothing more powerful than folks coming together and using their voices to inspire change. We're hosting a grassroots concert to get people to the polls across the country, and I hope you’ll join us. Chip in any amount to reserve your spot: https://t.co/Di1AIiRjHa https://t.co/v5wd2lR1wO	0

The Governor of California, @ GavinNewsom, has done a terrible job of forest management. I told him from the first day we met that he must “clean” his forest floors regardless of what his bosses, the environmentalists, DEMAND of him. Must also do burns and cut fire stoppers.....	1
..Every year, as the fire’s rage & California burns, it is the same thing-and then he comes to the Federal Government for $$$ help. No more. Get your act together Governor. You don’t see close to the level of burn in other states...But our teams are working well together in.....	1
....putting these massive, and many, fires out. Great firefighters! Also, open up the ridiculously closed water lanes coming down from the North. Don’t pour it out into the Pacific Ocean. Should be done immediately. California desperately needs water, and you can have it now!	1
The Whistleblower got it sooo wrong that HE must come forward. The Fake News Media knows who he is but, being an arm of the Democrat Party, don’t want to reveal him because there would be hell to pay. Reveal the Whistleblower and end the Impeachment Hoax!	1

If Shifty Adam Schiff, who is a corrupt politician who fraudulently made up what I said on the “call,” is allowed to release transcripts of the Never Trumpers & others that are & were interviewed, he will change the words that were said to suit the Dems purposes. Republicans...	1

False stories are being reported that a few Republican Senators are saying that President Trump may have done a quid pro quo, but it doesn’t matter, there is nothing wrong with that, it is not an impeachable event. Perhaps so, but read the transcript, there is no quid pro quo!	1

What I said on the phone call with the Ukrainian President is “perfectly” stated. There is no reason to call witnesses to analyze my words and meaning. This is just another Democrat Hoax that I have had to live with from the day I got elected (and before!). Disgraceful!	1
The Whistleblower gave false information & dealt with corrupt politician Schiff. He must be brought forward to testify. Written answers not acceptable! Where is the 2nd Whistleblower? He disappeared after I released the transcript. Does he even exist? Where is the informant? Con!	1

Bill Barr did not decline my request to talk about Ukraine. The story was a Fake Washington Post con job with an “anonymous” source that doesn’t exist. Just read the Transcript. The Justice Department already ruled that the call was good. We don’t have freedom of the press!	1
The degenerate Washington Post MADE UP the story about me asking Bill Barr to hold a news conference. Never happened, and there were no sources!	1
Read the Transcript!	1
Based on the information released last night about the Fake Whistleblowers attorney, the Impeachment Hoax should be ended IMMEDIATELY! There is no case, except against the other side!	1
“What did Hunter Biden do for the money?” @ SenJohnKennedy A very good question. He and Sleepy Joe must testify!	1
It was just explained to me that for next weeks Fake Hearing (trial) in the House, as they interview Never Trumpers and others, I get NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS. It is a Pelosi, Schiff, Scam against the Republican Party and me. This Witch Hunt should not be allowed to proceed!	1

Shifty Adam Schiff will only release doctored transcripts. We haven’t even seen the documents and are restricted from (get this) having a lawyer. Republicans should put out their own transcripts! Schiff must testify as to why he MADE UP a statement from me, and read it to all!	1

Schiff is giving Republicans NO WITNESSES, NO LAWYER & NO DUE PROCESS! It is a totally one sided Witch Hunt. This can’t be making the Democrats look good. Such a farce!	1
Just like Schiff fabricated my phone call, he will fabricate the transcripts that he is making and releasing!	1
In order to continue being the most Transparent President in history, I will be releasing sometime this week the Transcript of the first, and therefore most important, phone call I had with the President of Ukraine. I am sure you will find it tantalizing!	1
Schiff and the Dems have created this whole thing, they reverse engineer it. They’ve been vowing to impeach for three years. Why should we listen to them? Why should we want to?” @ greggutfeld @ FoxNews	1
“The President has until September 30th to give this aid to Ukraine. He gets it out on September 11th., 3 weeks before the deadline. So, we give our ally aid, and Joe Biden is not investigated. Remember that, they get the aid and we get nothing in return. The Democrats....	1

Why is such a focus put on 2nd and 3rd hand witnesses, many of whom are Never Trumpers, or whose lawyers are Never Trumpers, when all you have to do is read the phone call (transcript) with the Ukrainian President and see first hand? He and others also stated that there was.....	1

....Ukrainian energy company, and more millions taken from China, and now reports of other companies and countries also giving him big money, are certainly looking very corrupt (to put it mildly!) to me. Both Bidens should be forced to testify in this No Due Process Scam!	1

Joe Concha, The Hill: “In Emerson College Poll, Impeachment among independents, 49% Oppose, 34% Support. You see why Pelosi is reluctant to go in with this. Dems have to go home and explain why they haven’t done something on Opioid crisis, drug prices, USMCA, the Border, etc.	1
“The Democrats dirty tricks have started this whole thing. The Whistleblower, the guy who took his case to Schiff’s staff first, is what really blows the lid off this entire saga. He worked for Biden on Ukraine policy when Biden was VP. He worked for deep state henchman John	1
.....Brennan, too. And the Whistleblower also worked for Susan Rice. It’s an understatement to say that this is a Witch Hunt.” @ IngrahamAngle They spied on my campaign!	1

Great progress has been made by NATO over the last three years. Countries other than the U.S. have agreed to pay 130 Billion Dollars more per year, and by 2024, that number will be 400 Billion Dollars. NATO will be richer and stronger than ever before....	1

....When today’s meetings are over, I will be heading back to Washington. We won’t be doing a press conference at the close of NATO because we did so many over the past two days. Safe travels to all!	1
The Fake News Media is doing everything possible to belittle my VERY successful trip to London for NATO. I got along great with the NATO leaders, even getting them to pay $130 Billion a year more, & $400 Billion a year more in 3 years. No increase for U.S., only deep respect!	1

....”I would like to have the Attorney General (of the United States) call you or your people.....” This, based on what I have seen, is their big point - and it is no point at a all (except for a big win for me!). The Democrats should apologize to the American people!	1
Tremendous things achieved for U.S. on my NATO trip. Proudly for our Country, no President has ever achieved so much in so little time. Without a U.S. increase, other countries have already increased by $130 Billion-with $400 Billion soon. Such a thing has never been done before!	1
The Do Nothing Democrats had a historically bad day yesterday in the House. They have no Impeachment case and are demeaning our Country. But nothing matters to them, they have gone crazy. Therefore I say, if you are going to impeach me, do it now, fast, so we can have a fair....	1

The Do Nothing, Radical Left Democrats have just announced that they are going to seek to Impeach me over NOTHING. They already gave up on the ridiculous Mueller “stuff,” so now they hang their hats on two totally appropriate (perfect) phone calls with the Ukrainian President....	1

A PERFECT phone call. “Can you do us (not me. Us is referring to our Country) a favor.” Then go on to talk about “Country” and “U.S. Attorney General.” The Impeachment Hoax is just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which has been going on for 3 years. We will win! # MAGAKAG #2020	1

....had, while the Democrats are just looking out for elections. This President should just continue to fight like he’s always fought, for himself & for this Country. Continue to put forth policies like prescription drugs & trade policies. That’s what makes this President stand..	1

“The Senate shall set the time and place of the trial.” If the Do Nothing Democrats decide, in their great wisdom, not to show up, they would lose by Default!	1
PRESIDENTIAL HARASSMENT!	1
I got Impeached last night without one Republican vote being cast with the Do Nothing Dems on their continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt in American history. Now the Do Nothing Party want to Do Nothing with the Articles & not deliver them to the Senate, but it’s Senate’s call!	1

The great USMCA Trade Deal (Mexico & Canada) has been sitting on Nancy Pelosi’s desk for 8 months, she doesn’t even know what it says, & today, after passing by a wide margin in the House, Pelosi tried to take credit for it. Labor will vote for Trump. Trade deal is great for USA!	1
So after the Democrats gave me no Due Process in the House, no lawyers, no witnesses, no nothing, they now want to tell the Senate how to run their trial. Actually, they have zero proof of anything, they will never even show up. They want out. I want an immediate trial!	1
The House Democrats were unable to get even a single vote from the Republicans on their Impeachment Hoax. The Republicans have never been so united! The Dem’s case is so bad that they don’t even want to go to trial!	1
The reason the Democrats don’t want to submit the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they don’t want corrupt politician Adam Shifty Schiff to testify under oath, nor do they want the Whistleblower, the missing second Whistleblower, the informer, the Bidens, to testify!	1

A far left magazine, or very “progressive,” as some would call it, which has been doing poorly and hasn’t been involved with the Billy Graham family for many years, Christianity Today, knows nothing about reading a perfect transcript of a routine phone call and would rather.....	1

I will be signing our 738 Billion Dollar Defense Spending Bill today. It will include 12 weeks Paid Parental Leave, gives our troops a raise, importantly creates the SPACE FORCE, SOUTHERN BORDER WALL FUNDING, repeals “Cadillac Tax” on Health Plans, raises smoking age to 21! BIG!	1

Pelosi gives us the most unfair trial in the history of the U.S. Congress, and now she is crying for fairness in the Senate, and breaking all rules while doing so. She lost Congress once, she will do it again!	1
Nancy Pelosi, who has already lost the House & Speakership once, & is about to lose it again, is doing everything she can to delay the zero Republican vote Articles of Impeachment. She is trying to take over the Senate, & Cryin’ Chuck is trying to take over the trial. No way!....	1
....What right does Crazy Nancy have to hold up this Senate trial. None! She has a bad case and would rather not have a negative decision. This Witch Hunt must end NOW with a trial in the Senate, or let her default & lose. No more time should be wasted on this Impeachment Scam!	1
Wouldn’t it be reasonable to assume that Republicans in the Senate should handle the Impeachment Hoax in the exact same manner as Democrats in the House handled their recent partisan scam? Why would it be different for Republicans than it was for the Radical Left Democrats?	1

Why should Crazy Nancy Pelosi, just because she has a slight majority in the House, be allowed to Impeach the President of the United States? Got ZERO Republican votes, there was no crime, the call with Ukraine was perfect, with “no pressure.” She said it must be “bipartisan...	1
...& overwhelming,” but this Scam Impeachment was neither. Also, very unfair with no Due Process, proper representation, or witnesses. Now Pelosi is demanding everything the Republicans weren’t allowed to have in the House. Dems want to run majority Republican Senate. Hypocrites!	1

Brad Blakeman “I happen to believe as a lawyer that the charges are defective, they don’t meet the Constitutional standard of high crimes and misdemeanors, so I would like to see a Motion to Dismiss. At least 51 Republican Senators would agree with that-there should be no trial.”	1
Nancy Pelosi’s District in California has rapidly become one of the worst anywhere in the U.S. when it come to the homeless & crime. It has gotten so bad, so fast - she has lost total control and, along with her equally incompetent governor, Gavin Newsom, it is a very sad sight!	1
“Nancy Pelosi has no leverage over the Senate. Mitch McConnell did not nose his way into the impeachment process in the House, and she has no standing in the Senate.” Brad Blakeman. Crazy Nancy should clean up her filthy dirty District & help the homeless there. A primary for N?	1

Sohrab Ahmari, New York Post “The Trump Campaign raised $10 million in the two days following the impeachment (Scam) vote. It seems the Democrats have shot themselves in the foot in one more way. They set up a process they know is not going to lead to the Presidents removal, &...	1
....it’s alienating independents. This President is being persecuted over three years with one investigation after another, and that really plays to his base.” @ FoxNews @ cvpayne Their partisan Witch Hunt is hurting our Country do badly, & only bringing more division than ever!	1
A lot of very good people were taken down by a small group of Dirty (Filthy) Cops, politicians, government officials, and an investigation that was illegally started & that SPIED on my campaign. The Witch Hunt is sputtering badly, but still going on (Ukraine Hoax!). If this....	1
....had happened to a Presidential candidate, or President, who was a Democrat, everybody involved would long ago be in jail for treason (and more), and it would be considered the CRIME OF THE CENTURY, far bigger and more sinister than Watergate!	1

Iran never won a war, but never lost a negotiation!	1
General Qassem Soleimani has killed or badly wounded thousands of Americans over an extended period of time, and was plotting to kill many more...but got caught! He was directly and indirectly responsible for the death of millions of people, including the recent large number....	1
....of PROTESTERS killed in Iran itself. While Iran will never be able to properly admit it, Soleimani was both hated and feared within the country. They are not nearly as saddened as the leaders will let the outside world believe. He should have been taken out many years ago!	1
The United States has paid Iraq Billions of Dollars a year, for many years. That is on top of all else we have done for them. The people of Iraq don’t want to be dominated & controlled by Iran, but ultimately, that is their choice. Over the last 15 years, Iran has gained more....	1

As hard as I work, & as successful as our Country has become with our Economy, our Military & everything else, it is ashame that the Democrats make us spend so much time & money on this ridiculous Impeachment Lite Hoax. I should be able to devote all of my time to the REAL USA!	1
Iran is talking very boldly about targeting certain USA assets as revenge for our ridding the world of their terrorist leader who had just killed an American, & badly wounded many others, not to mention all of the people he had killed over his lifetime, including recently....	1
....hundreds of Iranian protesters. He was already attacking our Embassy, and preparing for additional hits in other locations. Iran has been nothing but problems for many years. Let this serve as a WARNING that if Iran strikes any Americans, or American assets, we have.....	1
....targeted 52 Iranian sites (representing the 52 American hostages taken by Iran many years ago), some at a very high level & important to Iran & the Iranian culture, and those targets, and Iran itself, WILL BE HIT VERY FAST AND VERY HARD. The USA wants no more threats!	1
They attacked us, & we hit back. If they attack again, which I would strongly advise them not to do, we will hit them harder than they have ever been hit before!https://twitter.com/DanCrenshawTX/status/1213583859402657793 …	1
The United States just spent Two Trillion Dollars on Military Equipment. We are the biggest and by far the BEST in the World! If Iran attacks an American Base, or any American, we will be sending some of that brand new beautiful equipment their way...and without hesitation!	1
These Media Posts will serve as notification to the United States Congress that should Iran strike any U.S. person or target, the United States will quickly & fully strike back, & perhaps in a disproportionate manner. Such legal notice is not required, but is given nevertheless!	1
“The reason they are not sending the Articles of Impeachment to the Senate is that they are so weak and so pathetic.” @ LindseyGrahamSC @ MariaBartiromo The great Scam continues. To be spending time on this political Hoax at this moment in our history, when I am so busy, is sad!	1
The Impeachment Hoax, just a continuation of the Witch Hunt which started even before I won the Election, must end quickly. Read the Transcripts, see the Ukrainian President’s strong statement, NO PRESSURE - get this done. It is a con game by the Dems to help with the Election!	1
Congress & the President should not be wasting their time and energy on a continuation of the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax when we have so many important matters pending. 196 to ZERO was the Republican House vote, & we got 3 Dems. This was not what the Founders had in mind!	1

Where have the Radical Left, Do Nothing Democrats gone when they have spent the last 3 days defending the life of Qassem Soleimani, one of the worst terrorists in history and the father of the roadside bomb? He was also looking to do big future damage! Dems are “unhinged.”	1
New polling shows that the totally partisan Impeachment Hoax is going nowhere. A vast majority want the Do Nothing Democrats to move on to other things now!	1
Nancy Pelosi will go down as the absolute worst Speaker of the House in U.S. history!	1

Wow! The wonderful Iranian protesters refused to step on, or in any way denigrate, our Great American Flag. It was put on the street in order for them to trample it, and they walked around it instead. Big progress!	1

مردم نجیب ایران، که آمریکا را دوست می دارند، سزاوار دولتی هستند که بیش از تمرکز بر کشتن آنها به جرم احترام خواهی، به آنها کمک کند تا به رؤیاهایشان دست یابند. رهبران ایران به جای آن که ایران را به سمت ویرانی بکشانند، باید هراس افکنی را کنار بنهند و ایران را دوباره باعظمت کنند!https://twitter.com/khamenei_ir/status/1218141834842660864 …	1

“Day after day, really good news on the economy. By the way, this didn’t just happen by accident, it’s the result of a lot of the policies that Donald Trump has put into place. Obviously, the Tax Cut, and now we have these two BIG trade deals.” @ StephenMoore Great future growth!	1
“Trade Deals Drive Stocks To Record Highs.” @ FoxNews	1
95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, A Record. Thank You!	1
They are taking the Democrat Nomination away from Crazy Bernie, just like last time. Some things never change!	1
Another Fake Book by two third rate Washington Post reporters, has already proven to be inaccurately reported, to their great embarrassment, all for the purpose of demeaning and belittling a President who is getting great things done for our Country, at a record clip. Thank you!	1
A massive 200 Billion Dollar Sea Wall, built around New York to protect it from rare storms, is a costly, foolish & environmentally unfriendly idea that, when needed, probably won’t work anyway. It will also look terrible. Sorry, you’ll just have to get your mops & buckets ready!	1
....BUT THE BEST IS YET TO COME!	1
If you listened to the flawed advice of @ paulkrugman at the @ nytimes, a newspaper that was going broke until I came along, you would have entirely missed the RECORD BREAKING Stock Market (and other) numbers produced since Election Day, 2016. Sorry, those are the FACTS.....	1
“Nancy Pelosi said, it’s not a question of proof, it’s a question of allegations! Oh really?” @ JudgeJeanine @ FoxNews What a disgrace this Impeachment Scam is for our great Country!	1

I will be going to Austin, Texas. Leaving soon. Always like (love!) being in the Lone Star State. Speaking to our great Farmers. They hit “paydirt” with our incredible new Trade Deals: CHINA, JAPAN, MEXICO, CANADA, SOUTH KOREA, and many others!	1
I have never seen the Republican Party as Strong and as Unified as it is right now. Thank you!	1
Now Mini Mike Bloomberg is critical of Jack Wilson, who saved perhaps hundreds of people in a Church because he was carrying a gun, and knew how to use it. Jack quickly killed the shooter, who was beginning a rampage. Mini is against the 2nd A. His ads are Fake, just like him!	1
I was thrilled to be back in the Great State of Texas tonight, where the people are known for being tough, strong, hardworking, loyal and fiercely patriotic — just like America’s incredible Farmers! # AFBF2020https://www.pscp.tv/w/cPTqejFvTlFsTFJub1dwUXd8MUx5eEJMV09yYllHTlRz-5NbV2gPeKOOkDEM8yurjH1YctdRkh2JVPtJ_Se1?t=5m20s …	1
“In the House, the President got less due process than the 9-11 terrorists got. This is a corrupt process?” Mark Levin @ marklevinshow “Very much so!” @ RepDougCollins @ FoxNews	1
